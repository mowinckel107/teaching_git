In The Colour of Magic, Rincewind acted as a guide for the tourist Twoflower, who hailed from the Agatean Empire in the Counterweight Continent, across the disc from the 'hub' continent where Ankh-Morpork is situated.
He was recruited for this because only he can communicate with Twoflower (they use Be-Trobi as a lingua franca), Twoflower agreed to pay him in rhinu (large gold coins), and because the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork wished to prevent an Agatean attack on Ankh-Morpork sparked by Twoflower's death.
He and Twoflower wandered around for quite a while, and were chased by everything from the personification of Death to a Lovecraftian creature named Bel-Shamharoth. 

Rincewind has the ability to pick up the essentials of foreign languages quickly and fluency only slightly less quickly, and appears to have the ability to blend in to any situation.
During The Colour of Magic, when he was projected into a universe that may or may not have been our own, he assumed the role of a nuclear physicist.
In keeping with his nature, the role was as a physicist who specialized in the 'breakaway oxidation phenomena' of certain reactorsâ€”or, to put another way, what happens when those reactors caught fire (Terry Pratchett served as the press officer for several nuclear power plants before he became a full-time writer).
Rincewind speculated on the nature of science, expressing hope in The Colour of Magic that there was something "better than magic" in the world, and speculated on the possibility of harnessing lightning, for which he was mocked by "sensible" Discworld citizens.
Rincewind is also fairly streetwise
 He is often depicted as a harsh critic of the selected stupidities surrounding him, even though he can't help but comply with whatever absurdity that arises.
 For example, in the computer games starring him, he consistently spotted the ludicrous events around him and would then make jokes and puns to the unaware participants.
 He also seems to display, despite his apparent failure as a wizard, a fairly extensive magical knowledge, recognizing various spells, magical artefacts and concepts throughout his escapades. 



# Sam Vimes

Sam Vimes was born in Cockbill Street as the son of Thomas Vimes, (son of Gwilliam Vimes) in the poorest area of Ankh-Morpork, so poor that there was little crime, though Sam was part of a street gang (The Cockbill Street Roaring Lads) with Lupine Wonse, who later became secretary to Lord Vetinari.

Vimes was educated at a dame school, where he was once blackboard monitor for a whole term, before he had to drop out and concentrate on learning about life out on the streets.
It is mentioned in Jingo that Sam Vimes' father, Thomas Vimes, had been a watchman prior to his death.
His mother would go on to tell young Sam that his father was 'run down by a cart when he was crossing the street'. He privately thinks later that his father was a drunk: "Vimes had never known his father.
His mum told him that the man had been run over by a cart, but Vimes suspected that if this were true at all, then it was probably a brewer's cart, which had 'run him over' a bit at a time for years".
She raised young Sam on her own, died about twenty years after the events of Night Watch and is buried in the city's Small Gods Cemetery.
In Night Watch Sam remembers that his mother made 'the very best' Distressed Pudding.




# Cohen the Barbarian

Also known as Ghenghiz Cohen, Cohen the Barbarian is the last and greatest of the barbarian heroes.
He is over 90 years old (or 87 in The Light Fantastic, in which he declares "If I wash twenty yearsh younger...I'd be shixty sheven"), which just goes to show how good Cohen is at not dying.
Known to be leader of the Silver Horde, a small group of similarly elderly barbarian heroes, many of whom have served with Cohen for numerous years.
Like Cohen himself, the Silver Horde is very good at not dying in a line of work where insane risks and life-and-death gambles are relatively routine (note we say 'and' instead of 'or' - this is intentional, as *someone* tends to die in the instances).
